Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 - Software engineering is the discipline of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software systems that are reliable, efficient, and meet the needs of users.

   Importance.
    - Quality Assurance: Software engineering ensures that software is built to be reliable and high-quality.
    - Scalability: Ensures that the software can adapt to evolving requirements over time.
    - Security: Software engineers follow best practices for building secure applications, protecting user data, and preventing malicious attacks.
    - Cost efficiency: By applying structured methods, software engineers help organizations optimize resources, meet deadlines, and avoid rework, which leads to better cost management.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
* The introduction of structured programming in the late 1960s:
       - As projects grew in complexity, there was a need to develop a disciplined way to write codes which led to the birth of structured programming and the use of loops and conditionals.

* The release of Unix operating system in the early 1970s:
      - it introduced the idea of modular, reusable code with a focus on simplicity and portability. The "pipe" concept—chaining small programs to handle bigger tasks—showed how software could be built as a collection of tools working together.

* The rise of Agile methodologies in the early 2000s:
      - They emphasized adaptability, customer feedback, and iterative progress over exhaustive planning. Practices like Scrum and sprints took off, enabling teams to deliver working software faster and respond to change on the go.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
 planning - identify the software requirement or purpose and scope.
 requirement analysis - identify the final user specification. 
 design - building the framework. 
 coding - converting software design into tangible code.
 testing - examine the software for any bugs and glitches


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
  - Waterfall is a straight line: plan everything, then design, build, test, and release—no turning back. It’s simple and predictable but stiff. If things change, you’re stuck. Best for projects with clear, fixed goals, like a government payroll system.
  
  - Agile is a loop: build a little, test it, get feedback, tweak it, repeat. It’s flexible and fast but needs good teamwork. Great for projects that shift, like a startup’s mobile app or a search engine update, where user input keeps changing the plan.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
  * Software Developers - They transform the user requirements into functioning programs using programming languanges.
  * Quality Assurance Engineer - They check if the program works as expected by running multiple tests on the program before it is deployed.
  * Project Manager - They plan the work, set deadlines, and make sure the team hits goals. They talk to clients or stakeholders to define what’s needed, manage the budget, and solve roadblocks

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
  * IDEs
     - A single app that combines writing code, debugging, and testing.
     - Has added features such as error highlighting and other built-in tools that make writing code faster and easier.
     - Example Visual Studio and IntelliJ Idea

  * VCS
     - It tracks code changes, letting multiple people work on the same project without chaos.
     - Example Git and GitHub

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
 - Dealing with unclear or changing requirements.
     => Use agile iterative approach to keep things flexible.

 - Debugging tricky bugs
     => Use fresh eyes to look for bugs or divide the code into chunks to find the bugs and fix them

 - Time and deadlines pressure
     => Break tasks into bite-sized steps and prioritize what matters.
   
 - Keeping up with new tech
     => Pick a few key areas to stay sharp in, like your main language or a hot framework, and learn incrementally

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
  - Unit testing checks the smallest pieces of code, like a single function or method. It catches bugs at ground level before they spread.
  - Integration testing monitors how the different modules work together. Promotes team effort and also ensures the modules work seamlessly.
  - System testing tests everything in a real-like environment. catches the bigger picture that other tests might miss out such as slow perfomance

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 - Prompt engineering is the art of crafting questions or instructions to get the best responses from AI models.

   * AI models rely on input to shape output. A sloppy prompt can lead to vague, off-topic, or downright weird replies.
   * Good prompt engineering saves time and boosts results. A well-tuned prompt can dodge biases or confusion baked into the AI’s training data.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
 * Vague: "Tell me about programming."

 * Improved: "Explain the basics of Python programming in 100 words."

   -The vague prompt risks a scattered, overwhelming response—maybe a mix of C++, Java, and random trivia. The improved one sets boundaries, so you get a tight, relevant answer tailored to your intent. It saves time, cuts fluff, and matches what you’re after, making the interaction sharper and more useful. Precision drives quality.
